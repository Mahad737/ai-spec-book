Digital twins enable testing **without risk or damage**.

---

### **SLIDE 4 – Why Simulation is Important**

Simulation allows:

* Safe testing of robot behavior
* Faster development cycles
* Cost-effective experimentation

Mistakes in simulation are safer than mistakes on real robots.

---

### **SLIDE 5 – Gazebo Simulation**

**Gazebo** is a robotics simulator that provides:

* Realistic physics and gravity
* Collision detection
* Multi-robot simulation

It is widely used with ROS 2.

---

### **SLIDE 6 – Sensor Simulation in Gazebo**

Gazebo can simulate:

* **LiDAR** – Distance and mapping
* **IMU** – Balance and orientation
* **Cameras** – Vision and perception

This helps test sensors before real deployment.

---

### **SLIDE 7 – URDF Integration in Gazebo**

Gazebo uses **URDF** models to:

* Load robot structure
* Define joints and links
* Attach sensors and actuators

URDF connects robot design with simulation.
