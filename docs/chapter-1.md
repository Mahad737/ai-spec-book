📘 **CHAPTER 1 – Physical AI & Embodied Intelligence**


### **SLIDE 1 – Chapter Title**

**Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics**
**Chapter 1: Introduction to Physical AI**

Understanding intelligence beyond screens — AI in the real world.

---

### **SLIDE 2 – Chapter Overview**

**What You Will Learn**

* What is Physical AI
* Difference between Digital AI & Physical AI
* Meaning of Embodied Intelligence
* Why humanoid robots matter

This chapter builds the foundation of the course.

---

### **SLIDE 3 – What is Physical AI?**

Physical AI refers to intelligent systems that:

* Exist in the real physical world
* Use sensors to perceive the environment
* Use AI models to make decisions
* Perform actions using motors and actuators

Physical AI systems follow real-world physics like gravity and balance.

---

### **SLIDE 4 – Examples of Physical AI**

Common examples include:

* Self-driving cars
* Delivery robots
* Warehouse robots
* Humanoid robots

These systems interact with real environments, not just data.

---

### **SLIDE 5 – Digital AI vs Physical AI**

**Digital AI**

* Software-only systems
* Works with text, images, data
* No physical interaction

**Physical AI**

* Has a physical body
* Senses the environment
* Moves and acts in the real world

**Physical AI = Digital Brain + Physical Body**

---

### **SLIDE 6 – What is Embodied Intelligence?**

Embodied Intelligence means:

* Intelligence that exists inside a physical body
* Learning happens through interaction with the environment
* The body shape affects intelligence

Humans are the best example of embodied intelligence.

---

### **SLIDE 7 – Why Humanoid Robots?**

Humanoid robots are important because:

* Our world is designed for humans
* They can use stairs, doors, and tools
* Human-like interaction is easier

Humanoids are ideal for human-centered environments.

---

### **SLIDE 8 – Sensors: Robot’s Senses**

Robots understand the world using sensors:

* Cameras → Vision
* LiDAR → Distance & mapping
* IMU → Balance & orientation
* Force sensors → Touch & pressure

Sensors act like human senses.

---

### **SLIDE 9 – Physical AI System Architecture**

A Physical AI system has four core parts:

* Sensors (Input)
* AI Brain (Decision making)
* Control System (ROS 2)
* Actuators (Movement)

All parts work together to create intelligent behavior.

---

### **SLIDE 10 – Why Physical AI Matters**

Physical AI represents a major shift:

* From digital intelligence to embodied intelligence
* From screen-based AI to real-world AI
* From passive systems to active agents

This is the future of AI and robotics.

---

### **SLIDE 11 – Learning Outcomes**

After completing this chapter, students will be able to:

* Explain Physical AI
* Understand embodied intelligence
* Describe humanoid robots
* Identify key sensors in robots

---

### **SLIDE 12 – Chapter Summary**

* Physical AI operates in the real world
* Embodied intelligence combines mind and body
* Humanoid robots fit human environments
* Sensors + AI + control = intelligent robots
