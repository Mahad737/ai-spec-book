# Chapter 7: Styling, Customization, and Completing the Book Syllabus

## 7.1 Purpose of This Chapter

Up to this point, the book has focused on **content, structure, AI workflows, and version control**. This chapter completes the **core syllabus** by focusing on **presentation and polish**. A well‑written book still needs proper styling and customization to feel professional and readable.

By the end of this chapter, the **main syllabus of the book is complete**. The remaining chapters will focus on deployment, maintenance, and best practices.

---

## 7.2 Why Styling Matters in Technical Books

Styling is not about decoration—it is about **readability and trust**. A clean, consistent design helps readers:

* Focus on content
* Navigate easily
* Take the book seriously

Poor styling makes even good content feel unfinished.

## 7.3 Understanding Docusaurus Theming

Docusaurus uses a **theme system** built on React and CSS. Out of the box, it provides:

* Light and dark mode
* Responsive layout
* Clean typography

You can customize the appearance without breaking the structure of your book.

---

## 7.4 Customizing Site Metadata

Open `docusaurus.config.js` to update visual identity:

* Site title
* Tagline
* Favicon
* Logo

These elements define the **branding** of your book.

Example fields:

```
title: 'AI Spec‑Driven Book'
tagline: 'From Idea to GitHub Pages'
```

---

## 7.5 Styling with Custom CSS

Docusaurus allows custom CSS through:

```
src/css/custom.css
```

Use custom CSS to:

* Adjust font sizes
* Improve spacing
* Highlight code blocks
* Enhance readability

Keep changes minimal to avoid breaking layouts.

---

## 7.6 Improving Readability for Long Chapters

Long chapters require extra care.

Best practices:

* Increase line spacing
* Limit line width
* Use headings frequently
* Break text with lists and code blocks

Readability directly impacts learning effectiveness.

---

## 7.7 Images, Diagrams, and Visual Aids

Visuals improve understanding, especially for workflows.

Guidelines:

* Store images in `static/img`
* Reference them in Markdown
* Use diagrams for architecture and flows

Avoid unnecessary images; every visual should add value.

---

## 7.8 Consistency Across the Entire Book

Consistency ties the syllabus together.

Ensure:

* Same heading patterns
* Same tone and depth
* Same formatting rules
* Same AI prompt style

Consistency is what makes multiple chapters feel like **one book**, not separate articles.

---

## 7.9 Final Syllabus Completion Check

At this stage, the **core syllabus is complete**:

* Concept & vision
* Specification‑driven planning
* Docusaurus setup
* Chapter structuring
* AI‑assisted writing
* Git & GitHub management
* Styling & presentation

You now have everything required to create and maintain a professional book.

---

* Understood the importance of styling
* Customized Docusaurus appearance
